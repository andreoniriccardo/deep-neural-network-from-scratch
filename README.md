# Deep Neural Network from Scratch
In this project, I build a deep neural network without the aid of any deep learning library (Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, …).
The reason for imposing myself on this task is that nowadays it is effortless to build deep and complex neural networks using the high-level tools provided by some python libraries. This approach allows machine learning practitioners to create powerful models with just a few lines of code, but it has the massive downside of leaving the functioning of those networks unclear.
